Hungry Python is a classic snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. In this game, you control a snake designed to look like the Python logo, and your goal is to eat food represented by logos of different programming languages.

## How to Play

3. Guide the snake to eat the food represented by logos of programming languages.
4. Avoid colliding with obstacles or the snake's own body.
